</span> Real browser synthetic monitoring allows you to test critical actions and requests that an end-user would perform
on your site at predefined intervals and in a controlled environment. You can view each Synthetic monitoring journey
in the Uptime app side-by-side with your other <a class="xref" href="monitor-uptime.html" title="Uptime monitoring">Uptime monitors</a>. The result is rich, consistent, and repeatable
data that you can trend and alert on.</p>
<p>For example, test popular user journeys, like logging in, adding items to a cart, and checking
out&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;actions that need to work for your users consistently.</p>
<p>Alerting ensures that any degraded performance or broken actions are fixed before impacting your bottom line or customer
experience.</p>

<p>The Uptime app in Kibana enables you to monitor the availability and response times
of applications and services in real time, and detect problems before they affect users.</p>
<p>You can monitor the status of network endpoints using HTTP/S, TCP, and ICMP checks, explore
endpoint status over time, drill down into specific monitors, and view a high-level
snapshot of your environment at any point in time.</p>
