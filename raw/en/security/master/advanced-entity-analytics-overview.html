<p>Advanced Entity Analytics generates a set of threat detection and risk analytics that allows you to expedite alert triage and hunt for new threats from within an entity&#8217;s environment. This feature combines the power of the SIEM detection engine and Elastic&#8217;s machine learning capabilities to identify unusual user behaviors and generate comprehensive risk analytics for hosts and users.</p>

<p>Entity Risk Scoring is an advanced Elastic Security analytics feature that helps security analysts detect changes in an entity&#8217;s risk posture, hunt for new threats, and prioritize incident response.</p>
<p>Entity Risk Scoring allows you to monitor the change in the risk posture of hosts and users from your environment. The risk scoring engine generates these advanced scoring analytics by factoring threats from its end-to-end XDR use cases, such as SIEM, cloud, and endpoint.</p>
<p>The next-generation risk scoring engine provides greater scalability and performance. It leverages the Elastic SIEM detection engine to generate host and user risk scores from the last 30 days.</p>
<p>It also generates risk scores on a recurring interval, and allows for easy onboarding and management. The engine is built to factor in risks from all Elastic Security use cases, and allows you to customize and control how and when risk is calculated.</p>
